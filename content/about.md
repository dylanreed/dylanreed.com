He founded [nervous](https://nervous.net) in march 2021. nervous projects include Adam Bomb Squad,  WVRPS, Broadside, Munko, and a bunch of others. nervous focuses on keeping it simple (stupid). 

Outside of nervous Dylan worked at V3 on projects with Budweiser, Bud Light, Pepsi, Ford, KFC, and many others, his focus at V3 was helping companies develop their web3 strategy. 

Dylan lives in Colorado with his partner and three very spoiled cats.
